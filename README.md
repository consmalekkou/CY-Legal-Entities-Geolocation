# CY-Legal-Entities-Geolocation
By Constantia Malekkou

### Objectives
The scope of the project was the exploration of the dimensions relating to Big Data. My projectâ€™s main focus was the Variety dimension. This dimension is about data that we can find in abundancy, that are unstructured, not organized in a predefined manner, and are found in various forms, for example text data, images, videos, and in this specific case geolocation data. The fact that they are in different forms presents difficulties to query, analyze and merge the different sources to gain valuable insights, and base business decisions on the available data. 

The final goal of this solution is to identify optimal physical store locations, given text address data of the business' customers. The project has been prepared as part of the Big Data Management and Processing course, for the Masters in Data Science for the University of Nicosia.

### Description
For the purposes of this specific project, we have taken the legal entities registered in Cyprus as a sample population. Data has been gathered through the 
[CY Open Data portal](https://www.data.gov.cy/dataset/%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%84%CF%81%CF%8E%CE%BF-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%B5%CF%80%CF%89%CE%BD%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%BA%CF%8D%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF) for all legal entities registered in Cyprus and their registered office addresses. The office addresses have been translated to geolocations through the Geocoding API in Google Cloud Platform.

Code was developed to run through JupyterLab Notebook with PySpark kernel on the Google Cloud Platform. The additional components needed for this project to run on the Google Cloud Platform are Dataproc with Compute Engine Virtual Machines and Storage Bucket. The code makes use of the PySpark Dataframe RDD data structure for fast and effective data processing. Persisting the entire legal entity population with geolocations RDD to disk storage was not pursued, as the dataset was quite large for the resources available. The results will be presented through a sample of 20k legal entities with geolocations, with the potential to grow to the full population given additional resources.
